# leddisplay-hardware
An LED-display based on WS2812-LEDs

## Overview
The schematics, plans, code and a few pictures will be published. Most of them in this repository.

The project started as an excuse to use a laser cutter and because I thought: A round led screen would be a nice thing to have. Since there wasn't one availbale for a reasonable price, I started to create my own.

Note: This is the first time I used a CAD-tool and the first time I used a laser cutter. Hence I made some rookie mistakes, but all in all the project looks okay. It's not 100% finished yet.

The code is already online, but in an early stage. You can get it overe there: https://gitlab.luxeria.ch/xermic/ledisplay

## Concept
TODO ;-)
